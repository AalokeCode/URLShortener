## Submitting a Pull Request

Once you have completed your changes and thoroughly tested them, you can submit a pull request (PR):

1. **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original **URLShortener** repository on GitHub and open a pull request (PR) from your branch. Follow these steps when creating the PR:
   - **Title**: Use a descriptive title that summarizes your changes, such as "Fix redirect issue for invalid URLs" or "Add analytics tracking for URL clicks".
   - **Base and Compare Branches**: Set the base branch to `main` (or whichever branch is specified by the project) and the compare branch to the feature branch you created.
   - **Description**: Provide a detailed description in the PR. This should include:
     - **Summary of Changes**: Explain what changes youâ€™ve made and why.
     - **Issue Link**: Reference any related issues by mentioning `#issue-number` if applicable.
     - **Testing and Verification**: Describe the tests youâ€™ve run to verify the functionality of your code, including specific scenarios or edge cases tested.
     - **Known Issues**: If there are any known limitations or areas needing further work, mention them here.

3. **Label and Assign Reviewers** (optional): If the repository has specific labels or allows contributors to assign reviewers, feel free to add relevant labels (e.g., `enhancement`, `bug`) or request a review from the appropriate maintainers.

4. **Keep Your Branch Updated**: If there are new commits on the `main` branch after you create your PR, update your branch to include these changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge origin/main
   ```
5. **Respond to Feedback**: After submitting your pull request, maintainers may review it and provide feedback or request changes. Hereâ€™s how to handle any feedback you receive:

   - **Make the Changes**: Apply any suggested updates directly on your feature branch.
   - **Commit and Push**: Once youâ€™ve made the requested changes, commit them to your branch and push the updates to your fork.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Address feedback: update URL validation logic"
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - **Update the PR**: The pull request will automatically update to include your latest commits. Consider adding a comment to the PR to summarize the changes made in response to the feedback, especially if multiple rounds of feedback are provided.

   > **Tip**: Stay engaged and respond promptly to feedback to ensure a smooth review process. If you disagree with any suggestions, feel free to open a respectful discussion within the PR comments.

6. **Merge Approval and Final Steps**: Once all feedback is addressed and maintainers approve your PR, it will be merged into the `main` branch. After merging, you can do a few optional clean-up steps:

   - **Delete Your Branch**: To keep your repository tidy, delete the feature branch from both your local machine and GitHub fork.
     ```bash
     git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
     git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - **Sync Your Fork**: To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, pull the latest changes from the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull upstream main
     git push origin main
     ```
